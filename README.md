# Converge
## Overview
Converge is a comprehensive web application designed to enhance productivity by assisting users in managing their time effectively. 

### Focus Tracker
The Focus Tracker component of Converge allows users to record and track their focus duration on specific tasks. Whether users are working on projects in teams or individual tasks, they can monitor the time spent on each activity. Users can start a timer when they begin focusing on a task, specifying the interval name and what project the task belongs to. Users can then edit the start and end times of concluded intervals for greater tracking accuracy. This feature is particularly useful for individuals looking to improve time management and productivity by accurately recording the time spent on each task, allowing users to gain valuable insights into their productivity patterns and can identify areas for improvement. This feature not only helps users stay organized and focused but also allows for better time management and project planning. 

### Project Management
Users can create and assign intervals to projects, streamlining organization and providing a clearer overview of tasks. This enhancement allows users to group intervals belonging to the same project together, facilitating better organization and streamlined workflow management by providing a structured framework for task management and project coordination. By categorizing tasks into projects, users can easily track progress, allocate resources efficiently, and prioritize effectively.

### Rooms
Rooms are dynamic virtual spaces where multiple users can collaborate in real-time. Each Room functions as a lobby where users can join to work on tasks. Users can see who else is present in the Room, what tasks they're currently working on, and the duration they've spent on each task. This fosters a sense of teamwork, accountability, and transparency among users. By having visibility into each other's tasks and progress, users can coordinate more effectively, share insights, and offer assistance where needed. 

### Reports
Converge's reports feature offers invaluable insights into users' productivity habits and project management endeavors. By providing a detailed breakdown of the percentage of time spent on each project over a selected period, along with a comprehensive overview of tasks completed and the cumulative time spent on each task, users gain actionable data to optimize their workflow and cultivate good productivity habits. These reports not only facilitate better decision-making and resource allocation but also encourage accountability and reflection. By understanding where time is invested most and identifying areas for improvement, users can refine their approach, prioritize effectively, and ultimately enhance productivity and efficiency in their work. With our reports feature, achieving your goals becomes not just a possibility, but a measurable reality.
